# QuantumQuest

Welcome to QuantumQuest! A top down RPG game of a Wizard using their Quantum Powers to escape the tower. 

This project is for a Physics and Computer Science Senior Project. The wizard, Q, will learn how to construct a spell from runes that will let them define how they move across the map to progress. Really Q is defined by 2 qubits, the runes are quantum gates, the spell is a quantum circuit and Q's fours possible states correspond to moving up, right, down and left. Thus, the goal of this project is to expose users to some of the non-intuitive logic we physics students learn in class. This is done through the common language of video games.

## How to run:
1. Clone/ Download the clone to a your computer
2. Open that directory in your preferred IDE
3. Run game.py

*Run through a terminal

4. $ cd ~/.../QuantumQuest
5. $ python game.py

## Roadmap
- Export the game as a single executable
- Add more QM principles (Entanglement, ...)

## Credits
Prof. Di Felice for her Mentorship!
